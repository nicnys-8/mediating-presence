<!--
 From Zigfu's website:
 "This app is a blank page that will simply display an alert when the Zig plugin loads.
 ...
 Note that you don't have to have an event handler for the loaded event. It's a good way of testing the basic functionality of the plugin, and for doing something different on your site based on whether or not the user has the plugin installed."
